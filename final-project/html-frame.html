            <p>On his first night at the Brooklyn homeless shelter, Tin Chin met his best friend.</p>
            <p>Estranged from his family, Mr. Chin was alone, stewing in anger and shame over all he had lost and how low he had fallen.

            <p>On that evening in 2012 in the Barbara Kleiman Residence in East Williamsburg, he saw only one other Chinese person in the room. The man was skinny, his ill-fitting clothes hanging loosely on his frame. Mr. Chin sized him up with an expert eye: an immigrant, most likely from Fujian Province; no family, no English, no documents.
